### DPD Branches in Symfony ###
This is a simple REST API working with external DPD service to load list and detail of DPD branches in Czech republic.
The FE part is intended to be as simple as possible and single page. Users have to wait a bit to load the data.
However, the main focus was on BE part. As a TODO, a page loader would be appreciated in the next version.

### HOW TO USE: ###
1, composer install
2, symfony server:start
